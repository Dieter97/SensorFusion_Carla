# Test Data

!!! Danger "File sizes"
    Many of the data sets used here are too large to include here in the portfolio!
    Therefore links to online location are provided where these data sets can be downloaded.

## Carla

The data used for the Carla tests is simulated. See the [user guide](../Documentation/start.md) for how to run the simulation.

More details explained in the [evaluation documentation](../Documentation/evaluation.md)

## BMW data sets

The BMW data sets are self recorded rosbags. As these files are +5GB they are not offline available in this portfolio.
As hosting these files would cost me money, you can always contact me if you need the files:
